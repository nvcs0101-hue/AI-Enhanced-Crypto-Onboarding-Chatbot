# Cryptocurrency Wallets Guide

## What is a Crypto Wallet?

A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital tool that allows you to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. Unlike a physical wallet, crypto wallets don't actually store your coins - they store the private keys that prove ownership of your crypto on the blockchain.

## Types of Wallets

## Key Wallet Concepts

### Private Keys
- Secret code that proves ownership
- Like a password to your crypto
- **NEVER share with anyone**
- Loss = permanent loss of funds

### Public Keys/Addresses
- Your "account number"
- Safe to share for receiving crypto
- Derived from private key
- Different format for each blockchain

### Seed Phrase (Recovery Phrase)
- 12 or 24 words that backup your wallet
- Can restore wallet on any device
- **Write down and store securely**
- **Never store digitally or share**

Example:
```
witch collapse practice feed shame open despair 
creek road again ice least
```

### Passphrase (Optional)
- Extra word added to seed phrase
- Additional security layer
- Creates "hidden wallet"
- If forgotten, wallet is unrecoverable

## Wallet Security Best Practices

   - Write on paper (metal better)
