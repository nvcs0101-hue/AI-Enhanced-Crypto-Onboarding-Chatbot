# Ethereum (ETH)

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and others. Unlike Bitcoin, which focuses primarily on digital currency, Ethereum enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).

## Key Features

### Smart Contracts
Self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code. They automatically execute when conditions are met, without intermediaries.

### Programmable Blockchain
Ethereum is "Turing-complete," meaning it can run any computation given enough resources.

### Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
A decentralized computer that executes smart contracts across the entire network.

### Native Currency: Ether (ETH)
- Used to pay for transactions and computational services
- Second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap
- Divisible into smaller units (1 ETH = 10^18 wei)

## Ethereum 2.0 (The Merge)

### Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
In 2022, Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake:
- 99.95% reduction in energy consumption
- More secure and scalable
- Validators replace miners

### Staking
- Lock 32 ETH to become a validator
- Earn rewards (4-10% APR)
- Help secure the network

### Sharding (Coming)
Future upgrade to split the network into multiple chains (shards) for better scalability.

## Smart Contracts Use Cases

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
- Lending/borrowing: Aave, Compound
- Decentralized exchanges: Uniswap, SushiSwap
- Stablecoins: USDC, DAI
- Yield farming and liquidity provision

### NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)
- Digital art and collectibles
- Gaming assets
- Music and entertainment
- Real estate tokenization

### DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)
- Community-governed projects
- Transparent voting mechanisms
- Treasury management

### Identity and Credentials
- Decentralized identity solutions
- Academic credentials
- Supply chain tracking

## Ethereum vs Bitcoin

| Block Time | ~12 seconds | ~10 minutes |
| Supply Cap | Unlimited (with EIP-1559 burn) | 21 million |
| Programming | Turing-complete | Limited scripting |
| Primary Use | dApps, DeFi, NFTs | Store of value, payments |

## Gas Fees

### What is Gas?
Gas is the fee required to execute transactions or smart contracts on Ethereum.

### How Gas Works
- Measured in Gwei (1 ETH = 1 billion Gwei)
- Gas price × Gas limit = Total fee
- Varies based on network congestion
- EIP-1559 introduced base fee + priority fee model

### Gas Optimization Tips
1. Use Layer 2 solutions (Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon)
2. Transact during low-traffic periods
3. Set appropriate gas limits
4. Batch multiple transactions

## Layer 2 Solutions

### Rollups
- **Optimistic Rollups**: Arbitrum, Optimism
- **ZK-Rollups**: zkSync, StarkNet
- Process transactions off-chain, post data on-chain
- 10-100x cheaper than mainnet

### Sidechains
- **Polygon (MATIC)**: Most popular Ethereum sidechain
- Separate blockchain connected to Ethereum
- Faster and cheaper transactions

## Getting Started with Ethereum

### Step 1: Get a Wallet
Popular Ethereum wallets:
- **MetaMask**: Most widely used browser extension
- **Rainbow**: User-friendly mobile wallet
- **Ledger/Trezor**: Hardware wallets for security
- **Coinbase Wallet**: Integrated with exchange

### Step 2: Buy ETH
Purchase from:
- Centralized exchanges: Coinbase, Kraken, Binance
- Decentralized exchanges: Uniswap (need ETH first for gas)
- P2P platforms

### Step 3: Interact with dApps
1. Connect wallet to dApp
2. Approve transactions
3. Pay gas fees in ETH
4. Always verify contract addresses

## Popular Ethereum dApps

### DeFi
- **Uniswap**: Decentralized exchange
- **Aave**: Lending protocol
- **Compound**: Automated lending
- **Curve**: Stablecoin swaps
- **MakerDAO**: DAI stablecoin

### NFT Marketplaces
- **OpenSea**: Largest NFT marketplace
- **Blur**: Pro trader platform
- **Rarible**: Community-owned
- **Foundation**: Curated art

### Web3 Tools
- **ENS**: Ethereum Name Service (.eth domains)
- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage
- **The Graph**: Blockchain data indexing

## Ethereum Development

### Programming Languages
- **Solidity**: Most popular smart contract language
- **Vyper**: Python-like alternative
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Front-end integration

### Development Tools
- **Hardhat**: Development environment
- **Truffle**: Smart contract framework
- **Remix**: Browser-based IDE
- **Alchemy/Infura**: Node providers

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Risks
- Code vulnerabilities (re-entrancy, overflow)
- Audits recommended before mainnet deployment
- Formal verification for critical contracts

### User Safety
1. ✅ Verify contract addresses
2. ✅ Check token approvals regularly
3. ✅ Use hardware wallets for large amounts
4. ✅ Enable transaction simulations
5. ❌ Never share seed phrases
6. ❌ Don't connect wallet to unknown sites
7. ❌ Be wary of "guaranteed returns"

## Ethereum Roadmap

### The Surge
- Sharding implementation
- 100,000+ transactions per second target

### The Scourge
- Censorship resistance improvements
- MEV (Miner Extractable Value) mitigation

### The Verge
- Verkle trees for better efficiency
- Easier node operation

### The Purge
- Reduce historical data storage
- Lower node requirements

### The Splurge
- Various improvements and optimizations

## Ethereum Economics

### Supply Dynamics
- No maximum supply cap
- EIP-1559 burns base fees (deflationary pressure)
- Staking rewards create new ETH (inflationary)
- Net effect: Slightly deflationary to neutral

### Price Factors
- DeFi activity and TVL (Total Value Locked)
- NFT market trends
- Layer 2 adoption
- Institutional interest
- Regulatory developments

## Environmental Impact

### Energy Consumption
- Post-merge: 99.95% reduction
- Energy use comparable to small data center
- Much more sustainable than Bitcoin

### Carbon Neutrality
Many Ethereum projects offset carbon emissions or use renewable energy.

## Common Questions

**Q: Is Ethereum better than Bitcoin?**
A: Different purposes. Bitcoin is digital gold; Ethereum is a smart contract platform.

**Q: Can I stake less than 32 ETH?**
A: Yes, through staking pools like Lido, Rocket Pool, or centralized exchanges.

**Q: What are gas fees today?**
A: Check etherscan.io/gastracker for current rates (typically $1-$50).

**Q: Is Ethereum a good investment?**
A: Depends on your risk tolerance and research. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

**Q: Can Ethereum smart contracts be changed?**
A: Depends on the contract. Some are immutable; others have upgrade mechanisms.
