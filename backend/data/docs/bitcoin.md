# Bitcoin (BTC)

## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It's a decentralized digital currency that operates without a central bank or single administrator.

## Key Features

### Decentralization
- No central authority controls Bitcoin
- Runs on a peer-to-peer network of computers worldwide
- Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography

### Limited Supply
- Maximum supply: 21 million BTC
- Currently ~19.5 million BTC in circulation
- New bitcoins created through mining (halving every 4 years)

### Security
- Secured by SHA-256 cryptographic algorithm
- Blockchain technology ensures transparency
- Immutable transaction history

## How Bitcoin Works

### Blockchain Technology
Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. Each "block" contains multiple transactions and is linked to previous blocks, forming a chain.

### Mining
Miners use computational power to solve complex mathematical problems, validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. They're rewarded with newly created bitcoins and transaction fees.

### Wallets
Bitcoin wallets store private keys that allow you to:
- Send and receive Bitcoin
- View your balance
- Sign transactions

Types of wallets:
- **Hardware wallets**: Most secure (e.g., Ledger, Trezor)
- **Software wallets**: Desktop or mobile apps
- **Web wallets**: Online services (less secure)
- **Paper wallets**: Physical printouts of keys

## Bitcoin Use Cases

1. **Store of Value**: Often called "digital gold"
2. **Payments**: Send money globally without intermediaries
3. **Remittances**: Lower fees than traditional wire transfers
4. **Investment**: Portfolio diversification asset
